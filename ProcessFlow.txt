Initialisation:
Step 1: Generate global graph for the process layout, which includes all possible paths between workstations (SOLVED)
Step 2: Generate all combinations for each mix, (SOLVED)
		and reduce to only logical combinations. (SOLVED)


Runtime:
// Internal
Step 3: Given a specific mix, we return the best combination at a given time. (SOLVED)
Step 4: Use the combination and the current global graph, to generate a path (SOLVED)
Step 5: Use the path to update the current weight in the global graph. (We can update the weights but don't know how/where)
// External
Step 6: Use the path to make the shuttle move (Anton)



Anton:
Problem right now, if there is a "collision" the replan function is called, this function creates a new placement
However right now this does not work, for two reasons:
1) The shuttles cannot move backwards and thus cannot plan a new path to the production station
2) Consequently, a new plan has to be made(combination of production orders), however since 
some of the tasks have already been completed, the new plan cannot be planned based on best_cominations.
3) Therefore a new best_combination has to be made, that can run on the fly.

 - Implement replanning method (Solved)
1) Find all distinct permutations for mixes left in the production order (SOLVED)
1.1) Keep track of the orders left in production order (SOLVED)
2) For each distinct permutations create a graph (SOLVED)
3) perform A* or djikstra (SOLVED)
4) keep track of the internal state of each shuttle including how far in the production order it is and its position (SOLVED)
4.1) Do this by creating a new class for shuttles (SOLVED)
4.2) Implement a shuttle manager (SOLVED)
5) Implement new functionality in the replan function (SOLVED)
6) Implement in main (SOLVED)
