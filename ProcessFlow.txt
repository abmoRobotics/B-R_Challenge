Initialisation:
Step 1: Generate global graph for the process layout, which includes all possible paths between workstations (SOLVED)
Step 2: Generate all combinations for each mix, (SOLVED)
		and reduce to only logical combinations. (TODO)


Runtime:
// Internal
Step 3: Given a specific mix, we return the best combination at a given time. (ROB6)
Step 4: Use the combination and the current global graph, to generate a path (SOLVED)
Step 5: Use the path to update the current weight in the global graph. (TODO)
// External
Step 6: USe the path to make the shuttle move (Anton)
