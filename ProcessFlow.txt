Initialisation:
Step 1: Generate global graph for the process layout, which includes all possible paths between workstations (SOLVED)
Step 2: Generate all combinations for each mix, (SOLVED)
		and reduce to only logical combinations. (SOLVED)


Runtime:
// Internal
Step 3: Given a specific mix, we return the best combination at a given time. (SOLVED)
Step 4: Use the combination and the current global graph, to generate a path (SOLVED)
Step 5: Use the path to update the current weight in the global graph. (We can update the weights but don't know how/where)
// External
Step 6: Use the path to make the shuttle move (Anton)



Anton:
Problem right now, if there is a "collision" the replan function is called, this function creates a new placement
However right now this does not work, for two reason:
1) The shuttles cannot move backwards and thus cannot plan a new path to the production station
2) Consequently, a new plan has to be made(combination of production orders), however since 
some of the tasks have already been completed, the new plan cannot be planned based on best_cominations.
3) Therefore a new best_combination has to be made, that can run on the fly.

 - Implement replanning method (Not solved yet)
1) Find all distinct permutations for mixes left in the production order
2) For each distinct permutations create a graph 
3) perform A* or djikstra

focus on replan
