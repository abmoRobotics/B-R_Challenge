This program cannot be run from within the aws-backend folder, it has to be moved to a toplevel folder at the same level as the aws-backend
folder. See example below.
then run _npm i_
after that you can run the _npm start_ command (see package file)
This will start publishing commands to an MQTT broker
and wait for replies from the aws-backend


OBS: 
This part is pretty bad, but a temporary solution.
The folder structure must be as below because there are dependencies in the example program main.js to the enums in the aws-backend program.
either move them and rewrite paths or you just have to live with it for now...

- top level folder
-- aws-backend
---enum
----erros.json
----mqttenum.json

-- student-program-folder
--- controllers
---- main.js
--- data
--- node_moduels
--- server.js
--- package.json
